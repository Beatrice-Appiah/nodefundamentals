# Step 1
Initialize the backend project for the mini application, using "npm init -y".

# Step 2
Install the packages we will be working with: That is nodemon, mongoose, dotenv, ejs and express; using "npm i <Package-name>".

    * ejs: allows html javascript to show dynamic content.

# Step 3
Initialize nodemon in our package.json and create an entry called app.js. Also define the necessary variables we will be working with in our env file and run the application.

# Step 4
We create the application model, to enable us interact our scripting code with the database. That is where moongoose package comes to play.

# Step 5
We move to app.js to start working on the localhost, database connection and API be working on as we proceed.

# Step 6
Create view files, that is ejs to implement the routes created so far in app.js
