## TechCrush Backend Development Journey 🚀
This repository is a comprehensive record of my backend development training during TechCrush Cohort 4. It documents my progression from Node.js fundamentals to building full-scale RESTful APIs and database-driven applications.

# Folder/File,Description
- INTRO_NODEJS: Introduction to the Node.js runtime, environment setup, and core modules.

- Week_2: Week-5,"Weekly modules covering asynchronous programming, file systems, and Express.js basics.

- Week5_StudentProfileGallery: A web application focused on CRUD operations for managing student profiles.

- Week6_Student-Manger-API: A RESTful API designed to handle student data management with backend logic.

- math.js: Early exercises focusing on JavaScript logic and module exports/imports.

- .gitignore: Configuration to keep node_modules and environment variables out of version control.


# 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Language: JavaScript (ES6+)

Database: MongoDB / Mongoose (for the API and Gallery projects)

Tools: Postman (API Testing), Git/GitHub, NPM


# 🌟 Featured Projects
1. Student Manager API
A backend-focused project where I built a system to manage student records.
- Key Features: Implementation of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
- Learning Outcome: Mastering status codes, middleware, and request handling.

2. Student Profile Gallery
A project blending backend logic with front-end rendering (likely using EJS or similar engines)
to display student information dynamically.


# 🚀 How to Run Locally
